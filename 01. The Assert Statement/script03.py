The implementation of the max_min_diff() function is given

Modify the implementation of the max_min_diff() function.

By using the assert statement inside this function, add the ability to
check the length of the numbers argument before returning the result.

If the length of the numbers object is 0 raise the AssertionError without any message.
Otherwise, return the correct result.

In response call max_min_diff() function passing an empty list.
